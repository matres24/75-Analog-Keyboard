also regarding your issue with the kbplacer plugin, a workflow that I like to use is:
use hierarchial sheets, one for each sensor
load in one of the footprints to kbplacer
disable diode auto-placement, disable auto-routing, remove "additional elements"
run the plugin
route the first sensor to its decoupling capacitors
use the "replicate layouts" plugin to replicate the placement of the remaining components and the routing
