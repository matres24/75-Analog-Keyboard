# 75%-Analog-Keyboard
A custom-built mechanical keyboard featuring Hall effect sensors for analog key press detection. This project uses DRV5055A4 Hall sensors, magnets mounted in keycaps, and a CD74HC4067 multiplexer controlled by a microcontroller. Each key press is measured as a variable voltage, enabling analog input functionality. RGB LEDs (WS2812B) provide per-key lighting. This project is meant to fit into Monsgeek M1 case.
